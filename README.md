StrategyPattern
===============

This project is practice for Design Pattern: Strategy Pattern.

In this case, I set a 'Camera' class as superclass.

So, there are many subclass: Canon ae-1, Olympus OM-1, Nikon FM2, Sony A7...

They all have defferent behaviors and attributes like: machinery or electronic shutter, film or CMOS, video function, battery type ...

Used the 'Strategy Pattern' to build a 'Camera'.
